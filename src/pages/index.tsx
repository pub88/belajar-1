      <p>The Origin of Patriarchy
Gail Omvedt
The Creation of Patriarchy by Gerda Lerner; Oxford University Press, New
York, 1986; pp 368, $ 8.95.
WHAT is the origin of women's subordina-
tion? Has it existed since the beginning of
human society? since the origin of private
property? of the state? of agriculture? When
did men gain power?
The traditional religious and later
bourgeois secular answer to such questions
has been that men have always been domi-
nant. Even while rejecting the notion of
divine creation of male superiority,
'androcentric' sociologists and anthro-
pologists (including the influential 'socio-
biological' school of today) have continued
to insist that the male-dominated family is
coextensive with human society, that even at
its very beginnings 'man the hunter' held
sway in the 'social' world and instituted co-
operative and productive relations while his
wife tended the home fires; and that this
basic situation has quite naturally continued
ever since. This view began to be successfully
challenged only with radical and socialist in-
tellectuals. In the nineteenth century Frederic
Engels, lising a few hints from Marx and the
research'es of the anthropological pioneer,
Lewis Henry Morgan, evolved a new syn-
thesis which stressed emerging class differen-
tiation and man's successful control of pro-
perty and the surplus as the base both for
the emergence of the state and male patriar-
chal control. It is this view that dominates
in much of the Indian left (and traditional
communist left in the world as a whole)
today.
But Engels' synthesis, however brilliant,
however using the most up-to-date anthro-
pological research of his time, is a hundred
years out-of-date, and his arguments have
been proved factually wrong on enough key
points to be seriously in question. (It might
also be noted that Marx, from the evidence
of the "Enthological Notebooks" and
elsewhere, had a rather different inter-
pretatidn of Morgan regarding women's
work and a rather different analysis of the
first states.) The most important of these was
his assumption that there was a natural divi-
sion of labour in which women were "pro-
ducers of life" while men were producers of
goods and thus the primary producers in
hunting, agricultural and herding societies.
Today we know that women play a major
productive role in hunting-gathering
societies (contributing 55-80 per cent of total
tribal food in such types studied) and in ear-
ly agriculture and that they were most like-
ly the inventors of agriculture and with it of
pottery and other storage facilities. This fact
alone is enough to disprove the thesis that
men's role in production gave them control
over an emerging surplus and thus the
material base to subordinate women in the
family; it raises the question, then what is
the basis of patriarchal power? In addition,
it should be noted that the empirical
material discussed by Engels for the origin
of the state and family was that of Greek-
Roman city-states emerging from the middle
of the first millenium BC, contemporaneous
with the Gangetic states in India but over
2500 years after the earliest states in
Mesopotamia and Egypt and about 2000
years after the Indus civilisation. In Engels'
time, it should be recalled, Mohenjo-daro
had not been discovered and the early dating
of Sumer was not known; but two millenia
is not an insignificant period for a historical
materialist analysis.
Today a new wave of feminist social
science has made a valuable critique of 'an-
drocentric biases' in these disciplines and ex-
posed the fallacies of socio-biology and the
'man the hunter' thesis. However, the pro-
blem remains that anthropological data as
such is limited; that is, the study of 'tribal'
or hunting-gathering or horticultural
societies as they exist today cannot simply
be generalised to earlier centuries and
millenia. (Indeed, this is one of thp points
of the critique; the marxist-feminist an-
thropologist Eleanor Leacock, for example,
showed brilliantly how the Iroquois were
equalitarian and even to a large degree
female-dominant in the 18th century, while
male domination gradually emerged by the
19th under the impact of European fur
trading and Jesuit teachings even while they
remained matrilineal and matrilocal.)
Now, however, we have Gerda Lerner's
"The Creation of Patriarchy" as the first
feminist history dealing with the rise of the
state and the question of origins. Lerner uses
archeological and written evidence (literary
sources and legal codes) to deal with the
Mesopotamian world-Sumerian, Babylo-
nian, Akkadian and finally Hebrew
cultures-between 3500 BC and 500 BC. The
result is a truly exciting work that provides
significant new evidence regarding the
origins of patriarchy and its connection with
the processes of state and class formation.
Lerner is at her best when she deals with
the period of the Mesopotamian states. She
is at her weakest when she deals with the
question of the origins of patriarchy/ gender
in the fourth millenium BC, for here she
relies on arguments by derivation and. not
on historical/archeological research, taking
the models developed by anthropologists like
Claude Meillasoux in studies of contem-
porary horticultural societies and applying
them to the neolithic period.
Briefly, Lerner argues that biological dif-
ferences proved basic for an early gender
division of labour and that once agriculture
began, this gave men the opportunity to seize
control. 'Elders' came to dominate over
'juniors' and men over women in a lineage
society that included patrilineal kinship and
the exchange of women. This puts the origin
of patriarchy in the 8000-3000 BC period,
when early agriculture yielded a surplus and
the beginnings of militarisation helped males
to seize control of the surplus and the main
producers of labour power, women.
This logic goes against certain evidence,
including some presented by Lerner herself.
Archeological evidence, for example, does
not corroborate the correlation of
agriculture with patriarchy. At most we can
see a transitional period beginning after 500
BC when there is some evidence for 'rank-
ed societies', though specialisation and trade
appear earlier. Studies of megalithic
monuments in early Europe show some early
ranking, but heirarchical elements appear
relatively late and it is suggested that only
after population density became high and
forced competition for the surplus did this
appear. This leaves thousands of years of
practising agriculture as such under
equalitarian and probably matricentric con-
ditions. The evidence for Catal Huyuk, a
well-researched Turkish town, shows a long
period of an equalitarian society (ca
6250-5720 BC) with evidence for a slight
dominance of mother-goddesses (Lerner, pp
33-35).
Finally, it may be noted that Lerner herself
shows that for the Mesopotamian societies
(the Sumerian city-states and others) there
were a good many matrilineal remnants in-
cluding early forms of matrilocal marriage,
dominance of the mother-goddess in
religion, etc, even after 3500-3000 BC. If
such remnants were strong even after the rise
of the state, it contradicts the notion that
patriarchal patterns had been consolidated
prior to this. At most one could say that
some of the roots of patriarchy were in the
neolithic period, but there is no evidence for
male domination itself.
With this important qualification, let us
look at what Lerner clearly establishes with
regard to the historical period of state
societies.
"The archaic state in the Ancient Near
East emerged. .. from the twin roots of
men's sexual dominance over women and the
exploitation by some men of others. From
its inception, the archaic state was organis-
ed in such a way that the dependence of male
family heads on the king or state
bureaucracy was compensated for by their
dominance over their families" (216). The early Sumerian city-states were clearly
dominated by men as priest-kings and later
secular warrior-kings; and male power in the
family-at least among the elite-is testified
to equally early by archeological and writ-
ten evidence. Lerner discusses, for instance,
the role of the 'stand-in wife', in which
women did play powerful roles as managers
of temples and estates, but only in terms of
their dependent relations with men.
Nevertheless the evidence Lerner provides
shows that in the first millenium of these
states women's subordination was relatively
less. Not only were there survivals of
matrilineal forms, some significant power
and status for queens and wives of the elites,
as well as the traditions of mother-
goddesses, it also appears from the discus-
sion of early sacred and secular 'prostitu-
tion' (I put the term in quotes since it clearly
had a different implication then) that
women's sexual subordination was not clear-
ly established. Among the fascinating
evidences is that in the Epic of Gilgamesh
(the earliest known poetic myth, whose most
complete surviving form dates from the
beginning of the second millenium BC) a
'harlot' plays a crucial role in bringing the
'wild man' Enkidu into the city to befriend
Gilgamesh:
... and he [Enkidu] possessed her ripeness.
She was not bashful as he welcomed her
ardour. She laid aside her cloth and he rested
upon her. She treated him, the savage, to a
woman's task as his love was drawn unto her.
This -alienates Enkidu from his forest life and
the wild beasts become afraid of him, "he
now had wisdom, broader understanding";
and he agrees to go to Gilgamesh. Lerner
comments: "The temple harlot is an ac-
cepted part of society; her role is
honourable-in fact, it is she who is chosen
to civilise the wild man. The assumption
here is that sexuality is civilising, pleasing
to the gods. The harlot does 'a woman's
task'; thus she is not set off from other
women because of her occupation. She
possesses a kind of wisdom which tames the
wild man. He follows her lead into the city
of civilisation" (132).
But this situation changed as women's
subordination deepened and as the roles of
wife, concubine, slave and prostitute became
clearly distinguished. Lerner's discussion of
salvery is an important one; she takes the
oppression of women as the basic model for
slavery; she notes that women were domi-
nant among the earliest slaves and that not
only were their sexual services important in
motivating their slavery but also rape in
general was a major factor in keeping them
enslaved and dominated.
The earliest written legal codes follow this
period, and the enforcement of women's
social, economic and sexual subordination
was one of their central themes. Lerner notes
that 73 of 282 laws in the Code of Ham-
murabi (1752 BC) and 59 of 112 Middle
Assyrian laws dealt with marriage and sex-
ual matters. These not only established the
power of male heads of the household, they
regulated minutely the sexual behaviour of
wives, concubines, mistresses and slaves in-
cluding such things as the veiling or unveil-
ing of women (it was a crime for a slave
woman or a harlot to veil herself), and
treated infringements of these with brutal
severity as crimes against the state. (It should
be noted that much of the evidence cited on
slavery is after the 2500-2000 BC period; it
seems slavery was not important in the
earliest period of the city-states but increased
with the increase in warfare.)
Perhaps, given the importance of the
study, it is best to let Lerner give her 'pro-
positions' in her own words, and then com-
ment upon them:
(a) The appropriation by men of women's
sexual and reproductive capacity occurred
prior to the formation of private property
and class society. Its commodification lies,
in fact, at the foundation of private property.
(b) The archaic states were organised in the
form of patriarchy; thus from its inception
the state had an essential interest in the
maintenance of the patriarchal family.
(c) Men learned to institute dominance and
hierarchy over other people by their earlier
practice of dominance over the women of
their own group. This found expression in
the institutionalisation of slavery, which
began with the enslavement of women of the
conquered group.
(d) Women's sexual subordination was in-
stitutionalised in the earliest law codes and
enforced. by the full power of the state.
Women's co-operation in the system was
secured by various means: force, economic
dependence on the male head of the family,
class privileges bestowed upon conforming
and dependent women of the upper classes,
and the artificially created division of women
into respectable and not-respectable women.
(e) Class for men was and is based on their
relationship to the means of production:
those who owned the means of production
could dominate those who did not. For
women, sex is mediated through their sexual
ties to a man, who then gives them access
td material resources. The division of women
into 'respectable' (that is, attached to one
manT) and 'non-respectable' (that is not
attached to one man or free of all men) is
institutionalised in laws pertaining to the
veiling of women.
(f) Long after women are sexually and
economically subordinated to men, they still
play active and respected roles in mediating
between. humans and gods as priestesses,
seers, diviners and healers. Metaphysical
female power, especially thF power to give
life, is worshipped,by men and women in the
form of powerful goddesses long after
women are subordinated to men in most
aspects of their lives on earth.
(g) The dethroning of the powerful goddesses
and their replacement by a dominant male
god occur in most Near Eastern societies
following the establishment of a strong and
imperialistic kingship. Gradually the func-
tion of controlling fertility, formerly entirely
held by the goddesses, is symbolised through
the symbolic or actual marrying of the male
god or God-King with the Goddess or her
priestess. Finally, sexuality (eroticism) and
procreativity are split ih the emergence of
separate goddesses for each function, and the
Mother-Goddess is transformed into the
wife/consort of the chief male God.
(h) The emergence of Hebrew monotheism
takes the form of an attack on the wide-
spread cults of the various fertility goddesses.
In the writing of the Book of Genesis,
creativity and procreativity are ascribed to
an all-powerful God, whose epitaphs of
'Lord' and 'King' establish him as a male
god, and female sexuality other than for pro-
creative purposes becomes associated with
sin and evil... (9-10).
Here, the greatest confusion comes with pro-
position (a). As we have argued, empirical
evidence is lacking for any significant subor-
dination of women before the rise of the first
states. These states (the Sumerian city-states
after 3500 BC) were clearly associated with
economic inequality and extraction of the
surplus from a subordinate peasantry. Yet
Lerner continues to make the definition of
'class' in the traditional Marxist terms of
private property and to identify the first class
society with slavery, which came later. If
'class' is instead defined in terms of produc-
tion and appropriation of suiplus labour,
then it seems these first states did have ex-
ploited and exploiting classes, however fluid
the lines were-only it was a state class, not
a private property holding class, that was ex-
ploiting. This means that state, class and
patriarchy arose together. (If we prefer not
to define 'class' in this way, then state,
economic exploitation and patriarchy arose
together.) However this requires a modifica-
tion of proposition (e). Above all, it mearns
that the theoretical problem of what factors
led to the formation of class society and
women's oppression remains unsolved.
Lerner's failure to really confront this
theoretical problem perhaps is connected
with the fact that her 'action' conclusions
avoid problems of how to overcome material
subordination and exploitation but instead
stress the role of feminist intellectual elites:
"In one sense, class struggle can be described
as a struggle for the control of the symbol
systems of society", she writes (222). Never-
theless this is an immensely important book,
and Lerner's call for a feminist histoiy
deserves to be heard in her own words:
... we will simply step out under the free sky.
We will observe how it changes, how the stars
rise and the moon circles, and we will describe
the earth and its workings in male and female
voices. We may, after all, see with greater
enrichment. We now know that man is not t'e
measure of that which is human, but men and
women are. Men are not the centre of the world,
but men and women are. This insight will
transform consciousness as decisively as did
Copernicus' discovery that the earth is not the
centre of the universe. We may play our separate
parts on the stage, sometimes exchanging them or deciding to keep them, as it works out. We
may discover new talent among those who have
always been living under the umbrella of
another's making. We may find that those who
had previously taken upon themselves the
burden of both action and definition may now
have more freedom for playing and experienc-
ing the pure joy of existence. We are no more
under an obligation to describe what we will
find than were the explorers sailing to the dis-
tant edge of the world, only to find that the
world was round (13-14).
The Parenthetical Woman
C S Lakshmi
Visibility and Power: Essays on Women in Society and Development
edited by Leela Dube, Eleanor Leacock, Shirley Ardener; Oxford University
Press, Delhi, 1986; pp 361, Rs 180.
THIS book deals with visibility and in-
visibility of women in anthropological
studies, in social and economic structure and
in private and public spheres and its relation
to the understanding of the power women
possess. The book is a collection of papers
which at various levels have taken the task
of critically evaluating accepted
methodologies and presenting various ways
of understanding the lives and experiences
of women. The book is divided into three
parts. The first part deals with 'Visibility and
Invisibility of Women'; the second pArt is on
'Women, Power and Authority'; and the
third part deals with 'Women and
Development'.
The book begins with a very precise in-
troduction by Leela Dube which does not
make any tall claims. She explains clearly
that the book provides an idea of the range
of important concerns relating to women
and to ways of thinking about them that
have emerged during the last decade and a
half. She also indicates that while there is
a common area of enquiry the scholars who
have written have been working with dif-
ferent sets of theoretical propositions and
conceptual formulations and hence this
volume presents often divergent points of
view. The introduction gives one hope for
it means there is still scope for discussion,
debate, argument and change of viewpoints.
Coming from social anthropologists, this
open door policy is a significant gesture and
ought to be regarded as one of the positive
aspects of what is termed Women's Studies!
The first part begins with a delightful and
extremely interesting paper by Shirley
Ardener on representation of women in
academic models. Ardener has analysed the
process of 'muting' through an examination
of the very presentation of so-called 'scien-
tific' diagrams, tables and texts and she pro-
ceeds to give quite a few examples of how
the 'male is generalised while the female is
specified'. According to her, "there is a tacit
assumption that men represent both the
sexes, unless special mention is made" (p 6).
Women are "regarded as a special variety,
a szb-class of man as it were" (p 6). Even
in linguistic usage it is natural to say male
and female but to say women and men
would mean 'marking' the phrase. She
points out that in graphs giving information
broken down by sex, the male is signified by
a dark solid line or structure and the female
data appears as a dotted line or a -shadow.
Ardener shows how a group can be 'muted'
by "the very way society encodes its data,
by the nature of its discourse, by the medium
contradicting the message" (p 13). 'Muted'
thus, women end up being the parenthetical
women. But in the final analogy she gives
of anthropologists being like a dog turning
in circles chasing a tail, Ardener slips herself.
"Should the dog grasp it in his (or her)
teeth", she says, "he will find he discovers
not the 'other' which he seeks, but himself"
(p 13; emphasis mine). It would have been
tough to avoid that parenthesis. It wouldn't
have been possible to say that an anthro-
pologist was like a bitch trying to catch her
(or his) tail. Maybe, the dog should have
been neutralised and it can be said to catch
its tail as is done in some of the Indian
languages. Obviously, the English language
has a lot of scope for making the female
parenthetical!
REPRODUCTION AND WOMEN'S
SUBJUGATION
There is much that bothers me in Claude
Meilassoux's paper 'The Pregnant Male'. His
main thesis is that women's reproductive
functions have become the source of their
subjugation by men. When he extends his
thesis to advanced societies he argues that
in advanced societies filiation is not much
of a concern and the emphasis is not on
reproduction any more and hence women
may gain in the competition with men on
the latter's ground. After this comes
Meilessoux's axe. Won't women, he says, be
lured into positions men are preparing to
desert? Won't they be giving up their "ac-
tual and decisive superiority on what is their
real strength: their hold on the future of
humanity" (p 20)? His entire thesis has as
its focus centre not women but men. He has
seen reproduction only as it affects men and
when again he talks of women in advanced
societies retaining their superiority by
holding on to reproduction since competing
with men is going to gain them nothing, he
is again making man the deciding factor. It
is as if a woman's life is constantly moulded
only as it relates to a man. Since production
of labour is again going to make her suc-
cumb to domination, she might as well hold
on to what she stdrted out with, seems to
his argument. It create this disturbing imi-
age in the mind of a whole lot of women
who are only agents of reproduction facing
a whole lot of men who would dominate
them because they cannot reproduce. He
seems to see women as one whole mass of
reproducing agents with no class or age dif-
ferentiation. According to him, reproduction
is not only the source of the women's sub-
jugation but it is also the source of her
superiority. So, if she continues to reproduce,
she would be subjugated and if she gives it
up she loses her superiority. Meilassoux, I
am afraid, is putting us in a double-bind.
The pattern he has drawn is rather neat but
however much tempting it is to simplify,
domination and subjection cannot be seen
in such one-dimensional terms. Not even by
male anthropologists.
Leela Dube's paper 'The Seed and Earth:
The Symbolism of Biological Reproduction
and Sexual Relations of Production'
discusses how the process of biological
reproduction is expressed in the metaphoric
use of the terms seed and earth for men and
women. By the.time I reached Leela Dube's
paper I had already gone the Shirley Ardener
way. The first thing that struck me was that
the author herself granted a greater position
to the 'seed'. She calls her paper 'The Seed
and Earth' and not 'The Earth and Seed'.
The term 'seed and earth' also immediately
brought to mind the male-on-top-of-the-
female sexual position. Although in her
paper she has effectively pointed out how
the female contribution to the formation of
the child is negated and made secondary to
that of the man, the symbolism seems to
have confirmed layers of unrecognised sym-
bolic memories in her own mind. And this
has extended itself to the title of the paper.
Maybe, Ardener is right when she says that
"when facing our purportedly objective
presentations of new facts, we are likely to
find our own folk images looking back to
us" (p 13). The symbolism as it is used in
old texts and as it is used in everyday life is
quite thoroughly brought out by Leela Dube
in her paper. She concludes that under-
recognition of women's contribution to the
economy is not unconnected with the
ideology of underplaying her role in the
human production.
Anny Tual analyses how Iranian culture
has conditioned the speech and silence of
women of Iran. In a very interesting paper
she brings out how speech and silence ale
used as forms of communication between
the sexes. The management of child-birth is
an issue that has become a very important
issue of concern to western science. Margaret
Stephens in her paper 'The Childbirth In-
dustry: A Woman's View' points out that the
current management of child-birth is in-
adequate because it falls entirely within the
medical jurisdiction, and in the hands of
western male doctors. Only the physical
aspects of child delivery are taken into con-
sideration to the almost total exclusion of
other aspects. She elaborates that an essen-
tially female experience has been taken ovcr
by the male doctors and that a woman feels
no sense of 'achievement' after her delivery
because her own participation is minimised
by the all-knowing male obstetrician. In
India, where women have almost taken over
gynaecology, one wonders if child-birth is
experienced as an 'achievement' by many.
One has known women humilitated and in-
sulted by female doctors and nurses "Don't
scream and shout. Didn't you feel good
when you did it?" is a sample of some of
